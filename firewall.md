## What is firewall
A firewall is used to protect our system or network. It can be prepared in software and hardware form. The firewall is placed in the way of the network to communicate with the outside world. In fact, anyone from the outside wants to communicate with our network, and on the contrary, their traffic is controlled by the firewall. In addition to being a firewall for the network, it is also for the operating system, which protects against hacking. Let's go to the ports, the first port is 1024, which of course goes from 0 to 1023, which are called well-known ports. The ports that are used for the main and well-known tasks, for example, port 80 is used for web protocol (http) and port 433 for https. Ports below 1023 and below are used for traffic tasks and the use of widely used and famous protocols, and from 1024 and above are unknown ports, and programmers are advised to use these ports so as not to cause interference. In its simplest form, the firewall is managing these ports. Now there are different types of firewalls, the most important of which are 
* 1- packet filtering 
* 2- stateful inspection 
* 3- application filtering 
* 4- next-generation firewall (ngfw) 
* 5- unified threat management (utm) Regarding their definitions, well, in the first step of packet filtering, it says that I can identify up to 4 layers, it recognizes layers 1 to 4, and based on its knowledge of these 4 layers, it can establish security.
