## what is diffrence with parallel and async.
Let's take a simple example for a better understanding, when you go to the bank and take turns, people do not go to the counters in turn, but they go to the counters depending on what they are doing. For example, counter number 2 is for opening an account and counter 1 is for transferring money, if you come to open an account, there are fewer people in front of you and your work will be done sooner, even though your number may be behind the person who came to transfer money. But if your card is money transfer, you have to wait for the people in front to do their work, then it's your turn.
It is the same in programming
We have a synchronous programming and an asynchronous programming
In synchronous programming, it means that the codes are executed in the order of the line and then they go to the next line, that is, first the 20th line of the code is executed completely, then it goes to the 21st line.
But in asynchronous programming, the case is exactly the opposite
That is, it doesn't matter if line 21 is executed in order to go to line 22
This was a short explanation with a simple example to help you understand this issue
